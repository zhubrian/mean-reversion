**Mean-reverting portfolio optimization: higher-order parametric models with regularization**

Abstract: In this paper, we frame the problem of finding a mean-reverting portfolio from a basket of assets as maximizing the likelihood that the portfolio follows a stationary time series model. To this end, we develop algorithms to optimize asset weights for autoregressive models of arbitrary order for the portfolio value time series with unregularized, L1-regularized, and L2-regularized objective functions. Using real-world data, we evaluate the effects of model order and regularization on a statistical arbitrage strategy, proxies for mean reversion, and information criteria for model selection. Our numerical results suggest that some metrics considered show improvements under moderate model complexity and moderate regularization in out-of-sample testing, and that L1-regularization promotes sparse mean-reverting portfolios.
